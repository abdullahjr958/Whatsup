## 🌍 Deployment

This app can be deployed on [Railway](https://railway.app):

1. Push your code to GitHub.
2. Create a new Railway project → **Deploy from GitHub repo**.
3. Add your environment variables in the **Variables** tab.
4. Railway will provide a live URL like:

   ```
   https://whatsup-production.up.railway.app
   ```

For the database, create a **MongoDB Atlas cluster**, get the connection string, and paste it into the `MONGO_URI` variable in Railway.

## 👨‍💻 Usage

* **Register/Login** to create an account.
* **Search users** and start a one-on-one chat.
* **Create groups** and chat with multiple users.
* **Send messages** in real-time without refreshing.
* **See last message snippets** for quick preview.

---

## 🔒 Security Notes

* JWT tokens are stored in **httpOnly cookies** (protected from JavaScript access).
* Cookies use `sameSite=strict` and `secure` in production.
* Refresh tokens are stored in the DB for validation and logout.
